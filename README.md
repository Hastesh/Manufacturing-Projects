Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing data to derive key insights related to operations, delivery time, and department performance. The dataset provided required extensive data cleaning, particularly of the prod_data.txt file, where we handled nearly 2,000 rows of raw data. The process involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing date formats, and normalizing inconsistent data entries to ensure a high level of accuracy for subsequent analysis.

Data Insights

The analysis focuses on manufactured quantity, rejected quantity, produced quantity, and processed quantity across various operations, delivery timelines, and department names. Each file provides a comprehensive overview of these metrics, offering actionable insights to optimize processes.

Excel Dashboards

The Excel dashboard offers a detailed analysis using pivot tables to summarize the data across various dimensions. Key features include:

Pivot Tables: Used for analyzing manufactured, rejected, produced, and processed quantities by department and delivery time.

Dynamic Filters: Allow users to filter data by operations, departments, and timeframes.

Charts and Visualizations: Used for visualizing trends and comparisons across different metrics.
